# Security Guidelines

## Supabase Security Implementation

### Service Role Key Usage (Server-side Only)

- User management operations
- Database schema modifications
- Payment processing
- Email services
- Background tasks

### Public Key Usage (Client-side)

- Public data reads
- Authenticated user operations
- Browser-based queries

### Security Best Practices

1. All sensitive operations use server actions
2. RLS policies implemented for all tables
3. Environment variables for all keys
4. Regular security audits
5. Input validation on all endpoints

## Authentication Flow

1. Initial auth through Supabase Auth
2. Session management with cookies
3. Protected route implementation
4. Role-based access control
